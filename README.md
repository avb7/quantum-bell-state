# quantum-bell-state

### Goals
To play with around the sample code given by the QDK kit to understand how different quantum operations are executed in Q#, and how a simple entanglement of two Qbits can be created using the Hadamand and CNOT gate

I'm writing this README to keep a log of concepts I learnt after going through some concepts of QComputing and Microsoft's QDK
### Concepts
#### Idea
The bell state is the simplest representation of entanglement. The pair of QBits are put in the Bell state with the following quantum operations:

#### Q# Implementation 


##### Microsoft's Quantum Development Kit 
This project was built and run using Microsoft's QDK.
